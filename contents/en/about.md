<center>Hi, my name is Stefanie and I create illustrations emphasizing color and style. I mostly create my art digitally using Affinity Designer, mainly focusing on portraits and creating designs. Outside from digital work I play on the piano for almost 9 years and paint in my free time. Look through my work below and feel free to chat with me about your next project idea.</center>
