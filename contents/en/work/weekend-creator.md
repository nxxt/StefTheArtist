  Yuka Ohishi is a video creator, delivers helpful tips for a creative activity for both digital and analog on YouTube. #weekendcreator is her movement to support anyone in their weekend creative work. I created the visual identity, logo and artwork for the project. The logo was inspired by a physical pencil, paired with the pen tool in Adobe products.
