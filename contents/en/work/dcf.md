  Disco Curly Fries was founded with the collaboration between Planeta, an online creative platform based in New York, and spice life, a t-shirt production and sales service. DCF allows users to design and purchase any full-graphic printed t-shirts, using the artwork of modern artists from all over the world to customize graphics. I was responsible for the e-commerce web design and artistâ€™s profiles.
